# Crop_Health_Dash
The aim here is to enable farmers respond quickly to issues that may arise in their fields by building a real-time crop monitoring dashboard using remotely sensed data (satellite imagery, in this case). By combining thermal and multispectral images, the code will analyse crop health, water stress, or even pest infestations. 
- an interactive dashboard that visualises and monitors crop health based on thermal and multispectral satellite imager, alongside other key data such as *weather conditions*
